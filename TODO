## seq tagger

###

- optparse to be able to train/tag ner/pos
- save corpus output, not only model in order to have the same tag and word
  indices
- tag in a way that can be used for
  - writing into a file (to eval with conlleval)
  - somehow create monitor channel that will monitor F1 score

### Refactor

- SequenceDataSpace would be better? Would it let us create >1 batch sizes?
- training is clear, tagging is difficult, because it needs cost function
- WordTaggerDataset.create_from_tagged_corpus is quite complex
