## seq tagger

- read wsj data into some data structure that will be good for SequentialSpace
- create a word tagger MLP that will tag a word with a fixed sized window
- create a network whose input and output spaces are sequential, runs former tagger_MLP on all words + runs a theano.scan() with an A (transition) matrix to compute final tag sequence probability
