###NNLM

- not to read whole corpus: done. TODO: read the file again, until there is no batch which gives any improvement. For this, there should be another validation set?
- understand hierarchical softmax: how does it look like compared to a layer of an MLP?
- understand negative sampling and NCE: can this be faster (and/or easier to implement in pylearn2) than HS?
- other improvements in the paper?
