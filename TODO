### fixed number of feature problem

In pylearn2, we cannot create IndexSequenceSequence space, i.e. a space with 2 varying dimensions.
But in a sentence, there is n words and for a word, there is f features.

1. use mutually exclusive features where possible (who gives a partitioning) like (lowercase, uppercase, camelcase, neither), or add redundant features for positive and negative presence, so the number of present features will be fixed. ["lower", "in_fornames_list=False"]
2. if we will definitely need a variable number of features, we can create a small ConvNet like network, that will transform any number of features into a vector, and then we can use VectorSequenceSpace as features for a sentence: for a given word (window) only a vectorspace input will be needed
